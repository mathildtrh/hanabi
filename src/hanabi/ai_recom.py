    This player uses the recommandation strategy, based on the principle of the guessing hat game

    Code for the self.CLUES :
      * from 0 to 3/4 = play cards from 1 to 4/5
      * from 4/5 to 7/9 = discard cards from 1 to 4/5
      * NB : if there are 4 or 5 players, 4 and 9 should never be used

    Algorithm to decide what action to do now:
      * if the latest clue was to play a card AND if no card was played, then play the recommended card
      * if the latest clue was to play a card AND if a card was played AND there is less than 2 red coins, then play the recommended card
      * if there is some blue coin available, give a clue
      * if the latest clue was to discard a card, then discard the recommended card  ####issue if it becomes an indispensable card!!
      * else, discard 1st card of the hand

    How to give a relevant clue:
      * play the "5" card with lowest index
      * play the card with lowest rank (+ lowest index if conflict)
      * play the dead card with lowest index
      * discard the not indispensable card with highest rank (+ lowest index if conflict)
      * discard 1st card of the hand
